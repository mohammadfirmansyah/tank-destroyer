## [2.0.0-RC.11] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- 🏆 **Achievement Popup HUD Transparency** - All HUD elements now properly fade
  - **Bug**: Only HUD elements directly overlapped by popup became transparent
  - **Fix**: Use CSS `!important` to override any inline styles or JS-set opacity
  - **Added selectors**: `.hud-top *`, `.controls-area *`, `#pause-btn`, `#minimap`
  - **Result**: ALL top-screen HUD elements fade to 25% opacity when achievement shows

- 🎮 **Game Start Full Quality Graphics** - Fix degraded graphics on deploy
  - **Bug**: Game started with lowest graphics setting, then slowly improved
  - **Root Cause**: `smoothPerfValues` retained degraded state from demo/previous session
  - **New `resetSmartPerformance()` Function** - Resets ALL performance values instantly
    - Resets `smartPerfLevel` to 0 (full quality)
    - Clears FPS history and bottleneck detection
    - Sets all `smoothPerfValues` to full quality immediately (no lerp delay)
  - **Called in `startGame()`** before canvas initialization
  - **Result**: Game always starts at maximum graphics quality

- 📝 **Improved PreWarm Console Logs** - Differentiate canvas initialization sources
  - `[PreWarm] Main canvas GPU initialized (page load)` - main.js on page load
  - `[PreWarm] Demo canvas GPU initialized (startDemo)` - demo.js for homepage battle
  - `[PreWarm] Game canvas GPU initialized (startGame)` - gameplay.js for actual game

## [2.0.0-RC.10] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- 📱 **GPU Pre-Warm Solution** - Fix first-frame canvas glitch on mobile devices
  - **Root Cause**: Canvas texture never initialized on mobile - GPU shows uninitialized buffer
  - **New `preWarmCanvas()` Function** - Renders dummy frame during page initialization
    - Draws checkerboard pattern to force GPU texture memory allocation
    - Fills with terrain base color (`#8B9A6B`) for seamless first frame
    - Uses `CTX.getImageData(0,0,1,1)` to force synchronous GPU flush
  - **Multiple Pre-Warm Points** - Comprehensive coverage across all entry points:
    - `main.js`: preWarmCanvas() called in initializeGame() after page load
    - `splash.js`: preWarmCanvas() called in initSplash() after assets loaded
    - `gameplay.js`: Full GPU pre-warm sequence in startGame() (checkerboard → fill → flush)
    - `demo.js`: Full GPU pre-warm sequence in startDemo() (checkerboard → fill → flush)
  - **Mobile-Specific Fix** - Targets Samsung, Qualcomm, Mali, PowerVR GPUs
    - First frame now shows clean terrain color instead of garbage buffer
    - No more black/glitchy frame on first game/demo screen transition
    - Works reliably on all mobile devices tested

- ⚡ **Faster Graphics Recovery** - Instant quality restoration when FPS >= 59
  - **Bug Fixed**: Graphics had noticeable delay returning to full quality when FPS improved
  - **Root Cause**: Single lerp speed (0.08) was too slow for recovery
  - **Solution**: Asymmetric lerp speeds - fast recovery, slow degradation
    - `PERF_LERP_SPEED = 0.08` - Slow transition when DECREASING quality (smooth degradation)
    - `PERF_LERP_SPEED_RECOVERY = 0.25` - FAST transition when RECOVERING quality (instant feel)
  - **Result**: Graphics snap back to full quality within ~12 frames (0.2 seconds) instead of ~75 frames (1.25 seconds)

- 🌐 **Chrome Mobile Cache Fix** - Prevent glitches from stale GPU cache state
  - **Issue**: Chrome Mobile (non-incognito) showed canvas glitches due to corrupt cached GPU state
  - **Detection**: Added `isChromeMobile()` function to detect Chrome on Android/iOS
  - **Version Change Detection**: Clear corrupt cache state when app version changes
  - **Extra Cache Clearing**: Chrome Mobile gets additional cache clearing on version update
  - **Safe Game Saves**: Only clears cache-related data, preserves player saves and high scores

## [2.0.0-RC.9] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- 📱 **Mobile GPU Compatibility Fix** - Prevent canvas glitch on mobile devices

    - Samsung Exynos GPU
    - Qualcomm Adreno GPU
    - ARM Mali GPU
    - PowerVR GPU
  - **Removed `will-change: contents`** from CSS - overloads mobile GPU memory

- 📺 **Improved Canvas Visibility Control** - Hidden during initialization
  - Canvas uses `visibility: hidden` during init (not just opacity)
  - Double `requestAnimationFrame` ensures GPU buffer is ready before reveal
  - First frame rendered completely before canvas becomes visible
- 🎮 **Demo Screen GPU-Safe Initialization** - Same fixes applied to demo.js
  - Reset canvas context state before demo starts
  - Use terrain color for initial fill
  - Delay demo loop start with `requestAnimationFrame`

  - First frame render delay ensures content is ready before visibility
  - Demo screen uses same robust canvas clearing pattern
- 🎨 **Dynamic Shadow Quality Scaling** - Smoother quality degradation
  - Blur intensity now scales with shadow quality (4px → 2px → none)
  - Shadow opacity now scales with quality for gradual fade-out
  - All shadow effects use `getShadowQuality()` for consistent behavior
- 🔄 **Smooth Graphics Recovery** - All effects restore smoothly when FPS improves
  - All quality values use `smoothPerfValues` with lerp interpolation
  - `PERF_LERP_SPEED = 0.08` ensures buttery smooth transitions both ways
  - Shadows gradually fade in when quality recovers from low to high
  - Tracks reappear smoothly when `trackQuality` lerps from 0 to 1
  - No sudden visual jumps when switching between quality levels
